SkyHorizon Asia

SkyHorizon Asia is a simple airline website. It lets users see flights between Asian countries, create an account, and book tickets.

2) Discounts: Some flights show a red badge if they are on sale.

3) Login & Signup: You can create an account with a username and password. You must confirm your password when signing up.

4) Booking History: If you are logged in, you can see all the flights you have booked.

5) Reviews: You can write a review and give stars to the airline.

6) Company History: A timeline showing how SkyHorizon started.

7) Mobile Friendly: The website works on phones and computers.


How to Run This Project:


Download the 3 files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.

Put them all in the same folder on your computer.

Open Visual Studio Code.

Open index.html.

Right-click on the code and select "Open with Live Server" (if you have that extension), or just double-click the index.html file in your folder to open it in Chrome or Edge.


Technologies Used

HTML: For the structure of the page.

CSS: For colors and design. I used Tailwind CSS (it loads from the internet).

JavaScript: For making the buttons, login, and search work.


Note for Github

This project is for learning purposes. It does not use a real database. All data (like users and bookings) is saved in your browser's "Local Storage". If you clear your browser history, the data will disappear.
